# Unsplash search app:

I'm creating a photo search app using unsplash api and `React.js`.
- Demo Link: [demo here](https://unsplash-search-app-cs.netlify.app)

**P.S: [docker](https://www.docker.com/) is required**

## installation:

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/cs-fedy/search-photo`
2. Change your current directory to the repo dir: `cd search-photo`
3. Install all the dependencies: `yarn install`
4. Add the unsplash api key in the `.env` file
5. Run the app in a dev env: `yarn run dev`

## used tools:

1. [React.js](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
2. [Unsplash api](https://unsplash.com/developers): Official Unsplash API. Create with the largest open collection of high-quality photos.
